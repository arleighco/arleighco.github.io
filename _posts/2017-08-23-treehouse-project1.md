<p>A pretty basic and straight forward customizing of existing code to create my own personal profile page.</p>
<p>I decided to go for the extra credit by adding pages, customizing a few CSS classes and adding additional images</p>

<p><strong>Suggestions</strong>
<ol>
  <li>Read project instructions and requirements</li>
  <li>Double check files</li>
  <li>Preview and Validate</li>
  <li>Don't be afraid to ask for help</li>
</ol>

<strong>3 common mistakes</strong>
<ol>
  <li>Image too large</li>
  <li>Missing HTML</li>
  <li>Errors</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><strong>Submitted - Fingers Crossed!</strong></p>
