title: Marked Down UX and Dev Notes
---
For the past few months I have been taking notes in Evernote during my Treehouse Front-End dev classes, and anytime I read a UX or dev book.

In an effort to practice HTML and CSS on a daily I am moving to using Jekyll on GitHub Pages using Atom and GitHub desktop.

These notes are for my own personal reference and practice.
